# Vibrating Table Prototype

## Overview

This project is a prototype for a vibrating table designed to improve the compaction of materials in various industrial applications. The vibrating table can be used for concrete casting, packaging, and other processes where material consolidation is essential.

## Features

- Adjustable Vibration Frequency: Allows users to set the desired frequency for optimal material compaction.
- Durable Construction: Built with high-quality materials to withstand heavy-duty use.
- User-Friendly Interface: Simple controls for easy operation and adjustment.
- Safety Mechanisms: Includes safety features to prevent overloading and ensure safe operation.
